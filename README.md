# Hands-On Machine Learning with Python
This course gives students basic ideas behind machine learning methods as well as a deeper understanding of how and why they work. Emphasis is placed on how to get these algorithms to work in practice, rather than focusing on mathematical derivations. Through a project-based approach, the course gives students the opportunity to implement algorithms themselves and gain experience with them. The course covers various machine learning techniques for both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. It also goes further to teach students about deploying a model into production.
